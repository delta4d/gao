common usage of `cut`.

1. `cut -c<POSITIONS>` extracts the chars, similar to `slice` in ruby.

```
# suppose operate on "hello"
cut -c2      # 2nd char, 1 based  => e
cut -c2,4    # 2nd and 4th char   => el
cut -c2-4    # range [2,4]        => ell
cut -c2-     # range [2,END]      => ello
cut -c-4     # range [1,4]        => hell
cut -c-      # range [0,END]      => hello
```

2. `cut -d<DELIMITER> -f<FIELDS>`, `-d` set delimiter, `-f` is similar to `-c`

```
# suppose operate on "hello,world"
cut -d, -f1   # => hello
cut -d, -f-2  # => hello,world
```
