We often need to find the first element in an array satisfies some condition.
Such as we want to find the first odd number.

```
a.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 }.first
```

can do it, but there is better, why do we need to find all odd number and then
return the first. If only ruby were lazy, we could do it. There is method for
`Enumerable` called `detect` do exactly what we want.

```
a.detect { |x| x % 2 == 1 }
```

Find familiar? It is just an alias for `find`, just like `size` and `length`.
Choose with your own interest.

We can also remove `x % 2 == 1` part.

```
a.detect(&:odd?)
```

`&` links symbol and proc in ruby.
