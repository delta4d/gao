In some ruby script, we can see `if __FILE__ == $0 ...` in the bottom of the file.
It ensures the file is running as a script, not execute by the other file.

`__FILE__` is the name of the file, `$0` is the main file name, it these two are
equal, it means the file is running directly.

It is similar to `if __name__ == "__main__"`. (TODO: learn some python...)
