- many things are pretty the same in ruby.
- `''` and `""` are the same.
- there is docstring, which is the same as common lisp.
- `string` and `tuple` are immutable.
- can not use array to simulate queue, which is different from ruby.
should use `collections.deque` instead.
- there is list comprehension, which is the same as haskell.
- `del` seems different from others.
- mutable operation always return `None`, it seems we can not chain operations.
- `str.format()` seems like `println!()` in rust.
