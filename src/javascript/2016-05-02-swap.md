It seems javascript does not have `swap` by default as in C/C++.

The basic idea is using a temporary value:

```javascript
// already have a, b
var t = a;
a = b;
b = t;
// a, b swapped!
```

There's too many code! If you have used some languages like [python][] or [ruby][],
you may see `a, b = b, a`, in javascript, you can use `[a, b] = [b, a]` in ECMA6.
If you have experience in functionally languages, this is the basic ability of
pattern matching.

[python]: https://www.python.org/
[ruby]: https://ruby-lang.org/

There is also some technique in early javascript, `a = [b, b=a][0]`, it seems
obvious, but the procedure is a little complex, I _guess_ it like this:

1. `=` operator first evaluates the right hand side (rhs as you may see in many
    articles).
2. array is built by values.
3. array evaluate order is from left to right.
4. first kept value of `b`, change value `b` to value `a`.
5. thanks to javascript's array literal notation.

Using the same technique, the fibonacci number generator can be written like this:

```javascript
// generate all fibs not larger than max
fib = function(max) {
    var fibs = [];
    var a = 0, b = 1;
    while (a <= max) {
        fibs.push(a);
        a = [b, b = a + b][0];
    }
    return fibs;
}
```
